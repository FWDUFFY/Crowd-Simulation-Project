Simulating human induced vibration and understanding the effect it has on structures is an empiritve part of the detailed design of bridge structures. 
In cases where the frequency of pedestrians walking/jogging has not been considered in the design, extreme amplitude in the structural vibration has occured due to a point of resonance being reached. This can lead to dramatic collapse of the structure. 

The Duhamel Integral is a simple way to simulate the response of a single degree of freedom system to any form of dynamic loading. 

This project was set up during my role as graduate structural engineer at DYSE in the design of a pedestrian ramp. This replaced the use of tedious spreadhseets and optimised the detailed design process. The visual outputs of the program offer context to what is an complex mechanical concept.
