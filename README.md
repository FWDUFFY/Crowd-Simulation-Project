Simulating human induced vibration and understanding the effect it has on structures is an imperative part of the detailed design of bridge-like structures. Resonance occurs when a system is subjected to an external force or vibration that matches its own natural frequency. In cases where the frequency of pedestrians walking/jogging has not been considered in the design, extreme amplitude in the structural vibration can occur when the imposed frequency coincides with the structureâ€™s natural frequency. This can lead to dramatic collapse of the structure. 

The Duhamel Integral is a simple way to simulate the response of a single degree of freedom system to any form of dynamic loading. 

This project was set up during my role as graduate structural engineer at DYSE in the design of a pedestrian ramp. This replaced the use of tedious spreadsheets and optimised the detailed design process. The visual outputs of the program offer context to what is a complex mechanical concept.
